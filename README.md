# BMI-calculator
=> Overview: This is a project where I built a BMI calculator to calculate the 'BMI' of individuals using their 'Height' and 'Weight' 
to determine their 'Weight Status Category' based on the different 'BMI Ranges.'

=> Methodology : I used Kilogram (kg) and Meters (m) as units of measurements for 'Weight' and 'Height,' respectively.

=> Categories: Underweight (< 18.5), Healthy Weight (18.5 - 24.9), Overweight (25.0 - 29.9), Class I Obesity (30.0 - 34.9),
Class II Obesity (35.0 - 39.9), Class III Obesity (> 40.0)

Technogies Used: HTML, CSS, and Javascript
